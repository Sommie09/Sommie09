### Hi, I'm Chisom :relaxed:

I am a Software Engineer working at the intersection of product, data and applied AI. I'm also a Multi-Published Author, Speaker and Creator on YouTube 👩🏽‍💻

I love technology and learning new things because it's my superpower for innovating and solving problems🚀

✅ **In 2019:**
I started my career as an Android Developer (which explains why I have alot of Android repos, lol), and then I launched my first app on [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chisom.igboamaka)📚

✅ **In 2021:**
I built my first data pipeline and I fell in love with Data Engineering, since then I've specialised mostly on Big Data!!

✅ **In 2025:**
I recently published my [second book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Engineering-Beginners-Tech-Today/dp/139432541X) on data engineering for beginners! (Published by Wiley Global✨)
and pursing a Masters in Computer Science with a specialisation in AI at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/), US🚀

**Career Philosophies**: Being an owner, having a growth mindset, and teamwork!
