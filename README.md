### Hi, I'm Chisom :relaxed:

I am a Software Engineer, Published Author, Speaker and Creator on YouTube 👩🏽‍💻

I love technology because it's my superpower for innovating and solving problems🚀

✅ **In 2019:**
I started my career as an Android Developer (which explains why I have alot of Android repos, lol), and then I launched my first app on [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chisom.igboamaka)📚

✅ **In 2021**
I built my first data pipeline and I fell in love with Data Engineering, since specialise mostly on Big Data!
